"""
In this problem set you work with cities infobox data, audit it, come up with a
cleaning idea and then clean it up.

Since in the previous quiz you made a decision on which value to keep for the
"areaLand" field, you now know what has to be done.

Finish the function fix_area(). It will receive a string as an input, and it
has to return a float representing the value of the area or None.
You have to change the function fix_area. You can use extra functions if you
like, but changes to process_file will not be taken into account.
The rest of the code is just an example on how this function can be used.
