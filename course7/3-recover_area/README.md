在此习题集中，你将处理城市 infobox 数据，对数据进行审核，然后想出清理方法并清理数据。

Since in the previous quiz you made a decision on which value to keep for the
"areaLand" field, you now know what has to be done.
因为在上一道测验中，你已经决定针对“areaLand”字段保留哪个值，你现在知道该如何操作了。

Finish the function fix_area(). It will receive a string as an input, and it
has to return a float representing the value of the area or None.
You have to change the function fix_area. You can use extra functions if you
like, but changes to process_file will not be taken into account.
The rest of the code is just an example on how this function can be used.
